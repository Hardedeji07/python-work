## üìå Notes

- The `Suspicious` column is mostly labeled as `indeterminate`, suggesting it may be a target variable for predictive modeling.
- Some transactions involve very high quantities (e.g., 61,216 units) and high sales values (e.g., 415,600), which may be from wholesale or bulk orders.
- The dataset includes a mix of low and high-value transactions, making it suitable for segmentation and outlier detection.

---

## üìà Suggested Analysis

- Identify top-performing salespeople and products
- Detect outliers in `Quantity` and `TotalSalesValue`
- Build a classifier to predict `Suspicious` transactions
- Explore relationships between product categories and sales trends
